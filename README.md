# Investment_Dashboard
Hello, this repository includes a personal project of mine and **as of November 21st, 2024 this project is still in progress**.
This project is meant to serve two functions: 1) Providing a one stop shop to analyze company financial performance over time (the accounting page serves as an example of how I plan on accomplishing this), 2) tracking the performance and accuracy of my ULTA stock pitch using a variety of benchmarks (the Pitch Accuracy page). To view the Ulta stock pitch click the Ulta Stock Pitch Outline PDF.

USAGE:
To use this page you can copy and paste the following URL into your browser: https://22browns.github.io/Dashboard/. Enter the ticker ULTA into the search bar and select "Search", two links should then populate below and allow you to naviagate around the webpages.

DISCLAIMER: This accounting and stock information pages were set up using Alpha Vantage and its free API calls, therefore not all ULTA information may be available, along with this after multiple API calls no data may be available due to the rate limiting set, this limiting resets daily.

The folder "Other Stock Pitches" contains the other pitches I have created that are not tied to this dashboard
